# Tweetalyser
A basic twitter scraper. Downloads the most recent tweets from the top 50 most followed handles and saves them in a database. Creates frequency dictionaries containing words, hash tags, mentions and emojis. Also contains an 'analyser' class containing simple methods to interrogate the data from each twitter handle.
